1. DIGITAL TO DIGITAL CONVERSION
 
 a. Line coding
 b. Block coding (optional)
 c. scramling (optional)

 Line Coding - 

 Sender ----> Encoder ----> Link(DIGITAL DATA) ----> Decoder ----> Receiver

 Characterstics :-

 Data element - smallest unit of data
 signal element - smallest unit of signal
 signal elements carries data element
 Data elements are what we need to send and signal elements are what we can  send.
 Mapping of data symbols to signals can be done based on r factor.

 Data rate is no of bits send per sec.
 Signal rate is corresponding to signal(Baud rate, pulse rate, modulation rate)
 It is advisable to increase the data rate by reducing the signal rate.
    S = c*N*1/r

 Baseline Wandering:- 
  
 The running average of the received signal is acalled baselining.
 Continous zero or one leads to baseline wandering which prevent the receiver from
 interpreting the signal correctly.

 DC Components:-

 When the signal voltage is constant for a while frequency will become zero(direct current component).
 Some media wont support low frequencies(telephone line below 200 Hz)
 
 Self Sychronization:-

 Sender receiver clock should sync properly.

 Line encoding - 

 Unipolar (NRZ)

 All signal levels are on one side of the time axis - either above or below (one polarity)
 NRZ - Non return to Zero Scheme is an example of this code. The signal level does no return to zero during a symbol transmission.
 Scheme is prone to baseline wandering and dc components.
 It has no Sycnhronization or error detection methods.
 It is simple but costly in power consumption.


 ex:  01001

     _1_        _1_
    |   |      |   |
    |   |      |   |
 _0_|   |_0__0_|   |_
-


Polar :-

NRZ - 

Voltages are on both sides of X axis.
Can be implemented with two voltages, +V for 1 and -V for 0.
There are two versions :-
    NZR (NRZ - L) - positive viltage for one symbol and negative for other.
    NRZ (NRZ - I) - the chnage or lack of change in polarity determines the                     values.



ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERSION

A digital signal is superior to an analog signal because it is more robust to noise and can easily be recovered, corrected and amplified.
Two methods used for conversion

Pulse code modulation (PCM)
Delta modulation(DM)

PCM

PCM consist of three steps to digitize an analog signal:
1. sampling
2. quantisation
3. binary encoding
The maximum frequency of the signal need to be limited for better sampling.
Filtering should ensure the quality of the signal.
The digital data received after processing is send to line coding.

Sampling:
Analog signal is sampled every Ts seconds.
Ts is referred to as the sampling interval.
fs = (1 / Ts) is called the sampling rate or sampling frequency
There are 3 sampling methods :
  Ideal - pulses from the analog signal are sampled and not easy to implement.
  Natural - a high speed switch is turned on for only the small period of time when the sampling occurs and retain the shape of the signal(varying amplitude).
  Flattop(commonly used) - sample and hold, generating a circuit 

Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is the name of this process.

Nyquist theorem states that, the sampling rate must be at least 2 times th ehighest frequency contained in the signal.
