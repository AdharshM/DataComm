TRANSMISSION MEDIA

UNGUIDED MEDIA : WIRLESS

Unguided media transport electromagnetic waves withput using a physical conductor. This type of communications is often referred to as wireless communication.

Radio waves
Microwaves 
Infrared

Radio waves = 3 khz to 300 ghz
infrared = 300 ghz to 400 thz
light wave = 400 thz to 900 thz

ground propagation - below 2 Mhz
sky propagation - 2 - 30 Mhz
Line of sight - > 30 Mhz


Radio Waves - 

Used for multicast communication, such as radio, tv, etc..
Can penetrate through walls
Omni directional antennas
freq range 3khz to 1 ghz
example : FM radio
covers large area and provides a higher transmission rate.
ground to sky propagation.

Microwaves -

Unicast lan, network, cellular networks.
Higher frequency ranges.
directional antennas - point to point.
frequency ranges from 1 khz to 300 ghz.
two types - terrestrial and satellite
terrestrial - ground based LoS
satellite - one earth station to another, wider range


IR -

It is suitable for short range closed area communication.
Uses Line Of sight propagation.
Frequency Range from 300 Ghz to 400 Thz.
High Bandwidth and high data rate.
Unreliable outside with interference of sun rays.
